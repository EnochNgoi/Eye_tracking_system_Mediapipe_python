# Eye_tracking_system_Mediapipe_python
Driver drowsiness is a significant and concerning issue contributing to road accidents. The act of operating a vehicle while feeling drowsy or fatigued poses a substantial risk to road safety. When a driver is drowsy, their cognitive functions, reaction time, attentiveness, and decision-making abilities are impaired. These factors increase the likelihood of accidents, making it a critical concern for both individual drivers and public safety.

# Overview 
This project utilises several Python libraries, including OpenCV, NumPy, MediaPipe, and pyttsx3, to implement eye tracking and blink detection in real-time using a webcam. The primary objective is to provide timely alerts to users when their blink rate deviates from the normal range or if their eyes remain closed for an extended duration. The application of this project is particularly valuable in scenarios where monitoring alertness is crucial, such as during activities like driving.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, MediaPipe, pyttsx3
- A working webcam

# Installation
To install the required libraries, run:
bash
pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe pyttsx3
